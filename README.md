# Wanki

A language learning tool powered by Anki.

## Introduction

Wanki is a Chrome plugin that gives analytics about the amounts of words learned from an Anki deck displayed on a web page.

## Goal

The idea is to create a language learning tool that allows users to control the difficulty of the material they might be reading on the web.

One of its targets also is to show the progress made as users know more words as well as helping them find new words they haven't learned yet.
